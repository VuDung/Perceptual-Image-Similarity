Implementation of *Average Image Hash* and *Hamming Distance* in Android Application  
the Average Image Hash algorithm is based on an article here: http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html  

I wrote a paper for this project here : http://section.iaesonline.com/index.php/JTI/article/view/240
